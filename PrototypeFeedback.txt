The GUI is clean and well-organized, with placeent of the fields in logical 
order common to other contact applicaitons. The simplicity is a change from 
commercial applications that put an emphasis on design, but this does not 
impact the ease of usability of the GUI. There are appropriate fields for 
esential contact information, I like the 'People', Import', and 'Export' 
tabs at the top and the three action buttons (Search, Add, Edit Profile) 
below.Everything is visible and self-explanatory.

The Search feature should be a fied instead of a button, which sorts as the user types. Also, the contact fields should include a catagory, linked to a asort feature,
with standard catagories like family, friends, work, but eabling user-defined catagories, too. The sort feature will than be used to sort by catagory or by other fields,
such as email domain.

Also, please change the Address field to include standard address fields like street addess, city, state/province, postal code, country,
and include more than one phone field option (home,work, mobile)

Another field might include Skype, WhatsApp and other messaging options.
And maye social media like FB and LinkedIn?
